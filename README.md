#Garry's Mod Unix-like Terminal

I was inspired by ExtReMLapin's [terminal 'GTerm'](https://github.com/ExtReMLapin/GTerm). So I made a derma panel for it using some of the features of his project along side some of mine.

Features currently included are:
1. Change Directory - cd
2. Print Working Directory - pwd
3. List - ls
4. Echo - echo
5. Catenate - cat
6. Clear - clear
7. Terminal Theming - "termcolor -help" for info.
